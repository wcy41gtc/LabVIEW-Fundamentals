Data acqusition systems consist of three main components:

#. Sensors to measure physical systems.
#. Signal conditioning/conversion.
#. A computing device with interfacing drivers and software for data monitoring/collection.

Sensors

Sonsors are sometimes called `transducers`, they are devices that covert physical quantities in the real world to electrical signals such voltage, current and resistance, etc. Most sensors needs electric excitaion (DC/AC power supply) and will output either analog or digital signals representing measured physical quantities.

Signal Conversion/Conditioning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Signal conversion and conditioning are the essential components of a data acquisition system. The output signals from the sensors can be catagorized as **Analog** and **Digital**.

Analog signals are continuous and features three primary characteristics:

1. Level (Amplitude)
2. Shape
3. Frequency

Digital signals are discrete and features two primary characteristics:

1. State
2. Rate
