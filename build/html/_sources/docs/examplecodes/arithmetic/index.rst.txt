Example Code: Arithmetic
========================

Overview
^^^^^^^^

This example VI demonstrates how basic math operations are done in LabVIEW.

The VI is incomplete, you need to wire the numerical controls to the corresponding indicators *via* the appropriate operators.

(Tips: use key shortcut ctrl+space to bring out quick drop menu and searh operators such as add, subtract, power, remainder, etc.)

Behavior
^^^^^^^^

If properly wired, the indicators should show correct numerical values depending on the operation performed.
